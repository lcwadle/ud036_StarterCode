# Upcoming Movie Trailers

This is the code to generate a webpage using **The Movie Database** to display up coming movies, their titles, release dates, and trailers.

## Structure

The code is written in python with three class files: **Movie**, **Website**, and **fresh_tomatoes**.

* Each movie is an instance of the **Movie** class.
* The **Website** class connects to **The Movie Database** and requests all upcoming movies including their movie information.  Next it uses the **fresh_tomatoes** class to output that information to the user via a web browser.
* Finally, when clicked, each movie plays the first video for the movie, often the trailer.
